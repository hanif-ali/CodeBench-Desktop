When adding something to the code, you will create a new branch and do all your work in that branch.
You can create a new branch by running `git branch new-branch-name`. For example,

To move to the new branch, run 
```
git checkout new-branch-name

You can check which branch you are on with `git branch`

Do all your work in the new branch and keep commiting your changes.

To upload your new branch to this remote repository run,

```
Push only the branches that you have created. Do not push to the `master` branch

Whenever updating your branch with other's changes in the branch, run 
```

```
